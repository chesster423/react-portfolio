       "description" : "The Valerian Isles, jewels of the Obero Sea. Long a center of naval commerce, the people of the isles struggled throughout history for dominion over her shores.\r\n        Finally there rose a man to put an end to this conflict: Dorgalua Oberyth. But history would know him as the Dynast-King. King Dorgalua strove to stamp out the hatred among the people of the isles, and for fully half a century, Valeria knew prosperity.\r\n        Yet upon the king's death, civil war erupted anew as three factions vied for control: the Bakram, who comprised much of Valeria's nobility; the Galgastani, whose people made up the majority of the isles' population; and the Walister, who numbered but few.\r\n        The isles were soon divided between the Bakram and Galgastani, and an uneasy peace settled across the land. Yet none believed the calm would last...",

        "description" : "Genealogy of the Holy War takes place on the continent of Jugdral, which is divided between eight countries: the Kingdom of Grannvale, the Kingdom of Verdane, the Kingdom of Agustria, the Munster District, the Kingdom of Thracia, the Republic of Miletos, the Kingdom of Silesse, and the Kingdom of Isaach.\r\n        According to staff, Jugdral is within the same world as Archanea, the continent featured in the original Fire Emblem and its sequels: the events of Genealogy of the Holy War are set hundreds of years prior to the time period of Archanea, with the latter being in a barely civilized state. It was during this time that the Dragon Tribes were debating how to treat humanity.\r\n        In ancient times in the year Grann 440, the Earth Dragon Loptous made a pact with the priest Galle, who became his vessel for bringing ruin to humanity. By 632, the Divine Dragon Naga had discovered Loptous's part in the gradual conquest of Jugdral, so she chose twelve soldiers to defeat Loptous: this event became known as the Miracle of Darna. \r\n        The Twelve Crusaders defeated Loptous and his cult, bringing peace to the land in a conflict dubbed the Holy Warâ€”these twelve would go on to establish Jugdral's countries. The events of Genealogy of the Holy War begin in the year 757.",
